# Papers We Love: Cork

This is the repository for the Cork chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/cork/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

Papers We Love: Cork is a community who loves reading and discussing academic computer science papers!

http://paperswelove.org/

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with?

Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers.

Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or give us the lowdown about the paper. Alternatively, just come, listen, and discuss.
